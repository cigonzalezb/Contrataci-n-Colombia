Two Mode Network of Public Procurement
======================================

## Prepared for ICPP4 - MONTREAL 2019

We use two-mode network analysis to explore two theoretical ideas present in the public management literature: that there is preferential attachment in public tenders, and that there are different trends in public procurement behaviours linked to the size of the administrative unit taking developing the tender. 

The first idea suggests that with more information, public entities look to hire companies that have a track record in supplying a certain good or service. Parallely, more experienced bidding companies are able to draft better proposals, increasing their chance to succesfully get a tender. Although we are not going to be able to explore the exact mechanism by which it happens, we look at determining whether if companies that have entered in contracts with government entities have a higher probability of entering contracts in the future. 

The second idea suggests that public entities operating at different levels have different behaviours in their public tenders. The main driver here is the different levels of administrative capacity public organizations have to produce more complex, complete and elaborate tenders. However, smaller offices with the potential to get assistance from bigger government offices might have a different behaviour than the ones that do not. 

We explore these two ideas using an open data portal for public procurement available from the Colombian government. The Electronic System for Public Procurement (SECOP) is an online platform that provides to services. First, it is the place where hiring transactions occur. Second it is a registry where of all the contracts between public entities and private companies in Colombia are recorded. The system was initially  implemented in 2011 looking to improve transparency and efficiency in public hiring procedures all over the country.  : *Camilo!*

> Camilo: quedarían tres cosas por hacer:

[] completar un poco la idea detrás del SECOP
[] Revisar que las dos ideas de verdad sean problemas que existan en la literatura de public management (Lo son según lo que yo encontré, pero usted es el experto)
[] Revisar el documento completo antes de mandarlo
